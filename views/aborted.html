<h2>Oops! Annoying glitch!</h2>
<p>Looks like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>we already delivered your coffee, <strong>or</strong></li>
  <li>the coffee machine hasn't been recharged yet, <strong>or</strong></li>
  <li>you just spotted a new bug <em>(wow, how lucky are you?!)</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can easily skip this message <a href="/reset">resetting the coffee maker</a>.</p>
<small>Well, I don't really care. <a href="/">Take me home</a>.</small>
